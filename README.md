## 📖 How It Works

- Tasks are created using JavaScript and dynamically added to the DOM.
- User interactions (add, delete, mark complete) are handled with event listeners.
- The app runs entirely in the browser.

> ⚠️ Note: Tasks will reset when the page is refreshed (no database or localStorage yet).
